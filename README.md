  ## Description
  Add Manager, Engineer and Intern roles to employer cards that display the employee's name , role, email and ID.  Depending on the role, the card will display the manager's office number, the engineers Github user name with a link to their Github page and the Intern's school.  All email addresses will link to the user's default email application along with the employee's email address in the 'to' line.

  The following npm commands will need to be executed to intall the necessary modules for the application: 
  ```
  npm inity --y

  ```
  The **test** value should be updated in *package.json* under the **debug** section within **scripts**:
  ```
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --verbose"
